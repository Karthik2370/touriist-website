1) Node.js is a javascript framework which is used to write the backend code of a website and connect any databases or call external
API's. It is just like PHP, but it is much more recent and hence we are using this instead of php because php is outdated.

2) Express.js is a node.js which helps to organize the code in node.js and it makes it easy for us to code web applications.
Basically what express.js does is, it already has a lot of functions so it shortens the amount of code we write in node, hence saving
us time.

3) In order to use any type of a module or a framework in node.js, you have to first install it using "npm install <package name> 
and to use it on your app, you use "require".

4) "get" basically means that you get some route or request some route. The default route is the home route which is also 
represented by a simple slash "/" . You can make as many routes as you want. For example "/about" or "/contact" . Ofcourse you will
have to write a get request for each and every route you have.

5) Axios is basically used to call API's. Axio's gives the ability to get the data available in any API and render it to our 
website.
